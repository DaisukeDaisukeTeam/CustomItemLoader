# CustomItem
A PocketMine-MP Plugin that implements custom item

# Plugin is not completed
Now I'm trying to make this, but I don't know when it is completed

# Reference
[wiki.vg](https://wiki.vg/Bedrock_Protocol)

# Don't report ANY issues
This plugin is under the development, if you open issue like `when the plugin is complete?`, `how to use this plugin?`, I will close the issue and remove issue creation section

# So, how does it work?

In MCBE 1.16.100, the `ItemComponentPacket` was added, and now we can register custom item in PM

but I don't know how to send item resource to client

if you know about this, please create issue and describe how to do them
